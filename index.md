I'm Milo Qureshi, I'm currently a rising junior studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology. 

I'm a game designer with strong skills in programming and art. 

I aim to work in an interactive field that combines aesthetics and code, which led me to major in game development.
I wish to utilize the multidisciplinary aspect of games and prove how versatile the medium can be.

I'm furthering my knowledge in object-oriented programming languages, game engines, and web development. I'm seeking internships in interactive media, software development, web development, and 3D modeling to advance my own skills.
