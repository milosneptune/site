Hello! 

I'm Milo Qureshi, I'm a game designer who crafts unique narratives, supported by strong technical skills in programming and 2D art. Currently, I'm a rising junior studying Game Design and Development at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

I've always been fascinated by animation. Since high school, I've been doing freelance illustrations and character design. In my later years, I picked up programming as a hobby and joined FIRST Robotics. I was captivated by the software development, and thus I realized I wanted to work in a field that combined visuals, code, and interactivity. 

Game development continues to inspire me and its multidisciplinary aspect proves how powerful the game medium can be. I want to develop and design impactful games that make use of its unique medium. 

As a woman of color, I am committed to uplifting others in this field. I understand firsthand the importance of representation, and I seek to help inspire the next generation in a way that wasn't done for me. 

At Rochester Institute of Technology, I'm furthering my knowledge in object-oriented programming languages, game engines, web development, and experience design. I'm seeking internships in interactive media, software development, web development, and 3D modeling to advance my own skills.
