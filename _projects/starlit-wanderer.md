### What is [Starlit Wanderer](https://granola.gg/town/project/332f794a){:target="_blank"}?
**Starlit Wanderer** is a short exploration game following an astronaut lost in space, and in their final moments, they reminisce on better times.

**Starlit Wanderer** was created as part of the Granola.gg game jam, and created in a team of seven over an (almost) 48 hour duration. 

This was quite the large team for my, and other team members, first game jam! Which did lead to many challenges. One of our biggest problems was maintaining a do-able scope, as we let the size of our team get to our heads. If I had participated in a team of seven for a game jam today, my experience during **Starlit Wanderer** would better aid me for success.
