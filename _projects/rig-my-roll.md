### What is [Rig My Roll](https://milosneptune.itch.io/rig-my-roll){:target="_blank"}?
**Rig My Roll** is a slot machine rogue-like high-level game prototype created by a team of four people as an assignment for the IGME-106 course, **Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms for Games**.

There were many challenging aspects we faced when creating **Rig My Roll**. The largest being that development was constrained to only two weeks, as well as our limited use of the MonoGame framework and the framework's minimal documentation.  

#### Role: Game Designer, Developer, Project Coordinator
  * Coordinated project tasks and organized task board, assigned tasks to team members, ensured project schedule
  * Implemented logic for randomizing and efficiently manipulating slot rolls, slot machine and item usage, and loading textures from file 
  * Presented pitch to a classroom setting 
  * Maintained consistent coding standards and conventions across project and encouraged use of version control 

**Tools:** C#, MonoGame Framework, Visual Studio, Trello
