### What is [a Path to Remembrance](https://milosneptune.itch.io/a-path-to-remembrance){:target="_blank"}? ###
**A Path to Remembrance** is a short creative GM-less role-playing game, designed to be under 200 words. This RPG was created by Giovanna Nelson and I. Seeking inspiration from childhood and playground games, we wanted to be able to play this RPG anywhere, using what's available to you at the moment. 

We decided to go for a more "unconventional" approach to the definition of "role-playing games", and created a journaling game that encourages people to engage in creative thinking processes.
